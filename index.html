				<p>
					The goal of this project is to design and implement an approach to utilize the space between the glass panels of double-pane facades to construct an <em>Adaptive Integrated Shading System (AISS)</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is especially important in high-rise building because they are subject to largely diverse climate conditions.
					At the same time, it is difficult to implement a durable external adaptive shading systems in such buildings.
					Furthermore, double facades could be used for this purpose. However, they are expensive and take up a large space.
				</p>
				<section>
					<h3 class="major">Wait, but what does 'Adaptive' mean?</h3>
					<p>
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_system"> Adaptivity</a> here means that the shading system is able to sense the environment, e.g., the sun position, or the weather, and <em>automatically</em> make decisions on activating or deactivating the shading functionality.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3 class="major">and what does 'integrated' mean?</h3>
					<p>
						The adaptive shading system has components integrated inbetween <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulated_glazing">the two glass panels of the facade</a>.
						These are electrochromic films, which are powered through a transparent PCB circuit.

				<h2 class="major">System Design</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>
					The system receives inputs from environment sensors such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodetector">photodetectors</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_temperature_sensors">temperature sensors</a>, in addition to user commands captured via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface">user interface (UI)</a> unit, such as a mobile app.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then a controller that processes the sensed values and the user commands instructs a driver unit to deliver power to the corresponding set of <em>Smart [Pixels]</em> via the transparent PCB selectively activating them.
				</p>

				<section>
					<h3 class="major"> Smart [Pixels]? </h3>
					<span class="image left"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>
						Our main contribution in this project, i.e., the Smart [Pixels], depends on the concept of smart (or electrochromic) films.
						So let's briefly learn about them first.
					</p>

					<h4>Electrochromic (Smart) Films </h4>
					<p>
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrochromism#Electrochromic_materials">Electrochromic materials</a> have intrinsic properties that enable them to reversibly change their color and/or their optical characteristics in response to electrical fields.
						In architecture, they are used as electrochromic glass systems (or smart glass) that are compact, scalable, and can react in real-time.
					</p>

					<h4>How do we turn smart films into smart [Pixels]?</h4>
					<p>
						The smart film is divided into [Pixels] to attain <em>local adaptivity</em> and great freedom in choosing the area of the facade that needs to be shaded.
						To this end, each [Pixel] is powered through the transparent PCB, so it becomes individually-switchable according to the controller commands.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3 class="major">Transparent PCBs?</h3>
					<p>
						<a href="https://www.pcbonline.com/blog/transparent-circuit-boards.html">Transparent printed circuit boards (PCBs)</a> are important in the field of optics.
						You can see through them, and even the conductive traces and components embedded in the circuit boards can be transparent.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since our goal is to achieve a shading system that is as transparent as possible to keep an open view and sufficient daylight, transparent circuits come in handy.
						They provide the smart films with power without hindering the facade's function.

			<!-- Use-Cases -->
			<article id="applications">
				<h2 class="major">Use Cases</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>
					Smart Film [Pixels] support a wide range of use-cases that fall under two categories.
					First, we have use cases that provide adaptive shading for buildings, and second, we have use cases that turn building facades into large-scale smart screens.
					Read below to find out more.
				</p>

				<section>
					<h3 class="major">Smart Film [Pixels] as a shading solution</h3>

					<p>
						The system can automatically react to the sun's position in the sky and activate [Pixel] selectively so that, e.g., direct sunlight does not enter the room while the same time the visibilty is not greatly hindered.
					</p>
					<p>
						The system can also respond to user inputs instructing it to uniformly activiate a specific percentage of [Pixels], e.g., 25% or 50%, so that a desired overall degree of shading is achieved despite the fact that smart films are normally only on/off-switchable.
						Individual users in large open office spaces can also freely select to turn shading on/off next to their desks according to their preferences.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3 class="major">Smart Film [Pixels] as a smart screen</h3>

					<p>
						When the building (or parts thereof) is unoccupied, the shading system can transform the glass facade into a large-scale smart screen, which can be used as an advanced advertising medium, or for aesthetic purposes.

			<!-- Smart Screen -->
			<article id="smart-screen">
				<h2 class="major">Smart [Pixels] Screen</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>
					When the building is unoccupied, the shading system can transform the glass facade into a large-scale smart screen, changing the entire aesthetics of the building.
					Moreover, most smart film technologies available in the market are on/off-switchable, i.e., the film is either transparent (on) revealing whatever below it, or it is opaque (off), which usually has a white color.
					A transparent film on the facade of a building reveals the embedding window, which is reflective during daytime, making it mostly blue due to the reflected sky.
				</p>
				<p>
					Therefore, we looked for techniques that allow the reproduction of monochrome images and videos using a display, i.e., the smart screen, with a very limited color palette (2 colors only).
					The actual appearance of the resulting monochrome images differ between daytime and night, and if lights are lit inside the building or if the facade is illuminated with external lighting sources. Moreover, if the smart screen is used to reproduce monochrome videos, the appearance is also affected by the positive or negative space surrounding the subjects in it.
					Two of the possible techniques that we can use to this end are <em>dithering</em> and <em>halftoning</em>.
				</p>

				<section>
					<h3 class="major">Dithering</h3>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither#Digital_photography_and_image_processing"> Dithering </a> in image processing is a technique used to create the illusion of color depth in images with limited color palette.
						Approximating colors not part of the palette is done by diffusing pixels colored with the available colors.
						The human eye perceives the diffusion as a mixture of the colors within it. Dithering is commonly used in digital printing and in digital image reproduction on low-end screens.

					</p>
					<p>
						To utilize dithering, the smart screen will be covered with square individually-switchable Smart [Pixels].
						By controlling the density of activated [Pixels], we can approximate any value on the color scale of the color reflected by the facade, e.g., blue in case the facade reflects the sky, resulting in monochromatic images.
					</p>
				</section>


				<section>
					<h3 class="major">Halftone</h3>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone">Halftone</a> is a photo reproduction technique that uses a uniform grid of dots of varying sizes to simulate continuous-tone imagery, resulting in a gradient-like effect.
						This technique was often used in printing when grayscale images were to be reproduced using only black ink on white paper.
					</p>
					<p>
						We also propose an approach to utilize halftoning to reproduce monochrome images, as follows: the smart screen is constructed from a uniform grid of round [Pixels].
						Each [Pixel] has the shape of a fixed number of concentric circles, e.g., 5 or 6, and the area between two adjacent circles, i.e., the ring between them, is made from an individually-switchable smart film.
						By activating more/less rings, we control the size of the resulting ?dot?.
						Finally, the number of rings in a single [Pixel] affects the achievable color depth.
					</p>
				</section>


				<section>
					<h3 class="major">Example Applications</h3>

					<p>
						Possible use cases for such smart screens include simple applications, like showing decorative shapes, patterns, and logos, or creating visual illusions.
					</p>
					<p>
						More sophisticated applications include responding to the music of a concert in real-time, or visualizing live statistics, such as the consumption of gasoline of the entire city for today.
					</p>
					<p>
						Especially interesting though are use cases that allow the smart screen to receive a live feed from a camera, e.g., to show a live event, or to catch the reactions of passers-by.
