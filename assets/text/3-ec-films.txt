Electrochromic (Smart) Films 
Electrochromic materials have intrinsic properties that enable them to reversibly change their color and/or their optical characteristics in response to electrical fields. In architecture, they are used as electrochromic glass systems (or smart glass) that are compact, can react in real-time, and are scalable.

Why Smart Material?
compact
Immediacy
Scalable
