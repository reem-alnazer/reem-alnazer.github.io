Electrochromic (Smart) Films 
Electrochromic materials have intrinsic properties that enable them to reversibly change their color and/or their optical characteristics in response to electrical fields. In architecture, they are used as electrochromic glass systems (or smart glass).

Why Smart Material?
compact
Immediacy
Scalable
